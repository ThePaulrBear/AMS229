    "An undirected graph $\\mathscr{G} = (\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E})$ is defined as a collection of two sets: a set of vertices $\\mathcal{V}$, and a set of edges $\\mathcal{E}$. If there is an edge $e_{ij}\\in\\mathcal{E}$ connecting the vertices $v_{i},v_{j}\\in\\mathcal{V}$, then we can assign an weight $w_{ij} \\geq 0$ to that edge to model the relative importance of that particular edge. Assuming the cardinality of the vertex set $|\\mathcal{V}|=n$ , we normalize the weights as $\\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}w_{ij} = 1$. This gives rise to a weighted directed graph $\\mathscr{G}_{W} = (\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E},W)$ where the edge weight matrix $W\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$ is symmetric with elements in $[0,1]$.\n",

    "A \"cut\" in $\\mathscr{G}_{W}$ is simply a partition of the vertex set $\\mathcal{V}$ into two (disjoint) sets: $\\mathcal{S}$ and its complement $\\overline{\\mathcal{S}}:=\\mathcal{V}\\setminus\\mathcal{S}$, that is, $\\mathcal{V}=\\mathcal{S}\\cup\\overline{\\mathcal{S}}$. The \"weight of a cut\" is the sum of weights for those (and only those) edges which connect vertices in $\\mathcal{S}$ to vertices in $\\overline{\\mathcal{S}}$. The \"max-cut problem\" concerns with finding a cut in $\\mathscr{G}_{W}$ that maximizes the weight of cut. \n",

    "In the following example graph with $n=4$ vertices, the \"red solid\" cut is the max-cut (cut weight = 0.7), while the \"blue dashed\" cut is sub-optimal (cut-weight = 0.5). In this example, the red max-cut corresponds to the partition $\\mathcal{V} = \\{v_{1},v_{3}\\} \\cup \\{v_{2},v_{4}\\}$. The sub-optimal blue cut corresponds to the partition $\\mathcal{V} = \\{v_{1},v_{2}\\} \\cup \\{v_{3},v_{4}\\}$.\n",
