    "An undirected graph $\\mathscr{G} = (\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E})$ is defined as a collection of two sets: a set of vertices $\\mathcal{V}$, and a set of edges $\\mathcal{E}$. If there is an edge $e_{ij}\\in\\mathcal{E}$ connecting the vertices $v_{i},v_{j}\\in\\mathcal{V}$, then we can assign an weight $w_{ij} \\geq 0$ to that edge to model the relative importance of that particular edge. Assuming the cardinality of the vertex set $|\\mathcal{V}|=n$ , we normalize the weights as $\\sum_{i\\leq j}w_{ij} = 1$. This gives rise to a weighted directed graph $\\mathscr{G}_{W} = (\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E},W)$ where the edge weight matrix $W\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$ is symmetric with elements in $[0,1]$.\n",

The \"weight of a cut\" is the sum of weights for those (and only those) edges which connect vertices in $\\mathcal{S}$ to vertices in $\\overline{\\mathcal{S}}$.
